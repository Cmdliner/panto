# Panto - Furniture Landing Page

This project brings a beautiful Figma Community design to life with modern web technologies. I discovered this stunning furniture landing page design on Figma Community and decided to recreate it using Next.js, adding responsive design features and mobile optimizations.

## Design Source

**Original Figma Design:** [Panto - Furniture Landing Page Design](https://www.figma.com/design/h1g3YDnbhqxYtwvuddTVA3/Panto---Furniture-Landing-Page-Design--Community-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=SwwHQfCgB6cIScGF-0)

## What I Added

- **Full Responsiveness**: Made the design work perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
- **Interactive Elements**: Added hover effects, smooth transitions, and interactive components
- **Modern Code Structure**: Built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Optimized Performance**: Used Next.js Image optimization and modern best practices

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
